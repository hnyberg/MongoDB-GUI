<h1>Desktop SCRUD-GUI to communicate with MongoDB</h1>

<h2>Assignment description:</h2>

<h3>Main goals for this assignment:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Show off your skills within the frames of the course "Java programming and database technology"</li>
<li>Learn useful technologies / frameworks to show up in your CV</li>
<li>Get to a repo on GitHub to impress</li>
</ul>
I want to leave this rather open and you decide for yourself:
Working solo or in groups (but let me know what you are doing before Tuesday next week)
Java and 1) JDBC, 2) any ORM framework or 3) different framework to link your code to the database
to design and create your own database with either 1) MySQL, 2) MongoDB or 3) any other database you want to learn
Some things, however, I see the obvious requirements.

<h3>To pass:</h3>
you publish your project on GitHub with attractive and detailed documentation (give me the link)
Using neat and object-oriented Java with at least one computer science class we worked with in the course
you can explain what your code does
your application has CRUD and search
<h3>For higher grade:</h3>
Same as above, plus:
your application uses the aggregation of at least two ways (display meta-data / info-on-the info)
solving project in an independent and professional manner
showcases the ability to create good code that not only solves the problem but also is well structured
You can explain what your code does and shows good understanding of how and why you chose your solution
